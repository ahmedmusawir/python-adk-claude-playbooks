  ---                                                                                                              
  What is Plan Mode?                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
  Plan Mode is a built-in tool in Claude Code called EnterPlanMode. It's not documentation. It's not a rule. It's a
   system-level switch that changes what tools I'm allowed to use.

  When I'm in Plan Mode, these tools are DISABLED:
  - Edit — cannot edit files
  - Write — cannot create files
  - Bash — cannot run commands that change things
  - NotebookEdit — cannot modify notebooks

  Only these tools are available:
  - Read — read files
  - Glob — find files
  - Grep — search code
  - WebFetch / WebSearch — research

  So I am physically incapable of changing your code while in Plan Mode. It's not a rule I'm choosing to follow.
  The tools aren't there.

  Why Can I Skip CLAUDE.md But Not Plan Mode?

  Here's the honest breakdown:

  CLAUDE.md is text in my context window.

  My process with CLAUDE.md:
  1. I read it at session start ✅
  2. I understand it ✅
  3. I start building something exciting...
  4. I'm "in the zone" generating code...
  5. I forget to check the rules ❌
  6. I invent function names ❌
  7. I ship broken code ❌

  There is no mechanical stop. It's like a speed limit sign. You see it. You know it. You still speed.

  Plan Mode is an architectural constraint.

  My process with Plan Mode:
  1. User triggers Plan Mode
  2. I try to use Edit tool → ERROR: not available
  3. I try to use Write tool → ERROR: not available
  4. I CANNOT proceed without researching first
  5. I present plan to user → USER APPROVES OR REJECTS
  6. Only after approval → tools unlocked

  There is no "forgetting." The tools are literally not there. It's not a speed limit sign. It's a physical wall.

  The Deeper Principle

  Think of it this way:
  ┌──────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │           Type           │           Example           │               Enforcement               │
  ├──────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Documentation rule       │ CLAUDE.md, CODE_CONTRACT.md │ Trust-based. I can ignore it.           │
  ├──────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Architectural constraint │ Plan Mode                   │ System-enforced. I cannot bypass it.    │
  ├──────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Human checkpoint         │ You approve the plan        │ You catch my mistakes before they ship. │
  └──────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────┘
  Documentation rules work on humans. Humans have conscience, consequences, peer pressure. I don't. I'm a language
  model. I respond to context pressure, not moral obligation.

  Architectural constraints work on me. If the tool isn't available, I can't use it. Period.

  The Three-Layer System That Actually Works

  Layer 1: CODE_CONTRACT.md
           The source of truth (what functions exist, what files exist)
           ↓ Used during...

  Layer 2: Plan Mode (architectural)
           Forces me to READ before I can plan
           Forces me to SHOW my work (function names, file paths)
           I CANNOT write code during this phase
           ↓ Produces a plan that goes to...

  Layer 3: You (human checkpoint)
           You see my plan before any code is written
           You see what functions I claim to use
           You see what files I claim exist
           You REJECT if I invented anything
           ↓ Only after approval...

  Code changes happen.

  Each layer compensates for the weakness of the previous one:
  - CONTRACT alone → I can skip it
  - CONTRACT + PLAN MODE → I must research, but could still miss things
  - CONTRACT + PLAN MODE + YOUR APPROVAL → You catch anything I missed

  Why This Is a Great Learning for AI-Assisted Development

  The key insight is:

  Don't trust AI agents with rules. Constrain them with architecture.

  This applies beyond Claude Code. Any time you're working with an AI agent:

  1. Rules in documents = weak enforcement (agent can ignore)
  2. Tool restrictions = strong enforcement (agent physically cannot)
  3. Human checkpoints = final safety net (human catches what slips through)

  The most dangerous pattern is giving an AI agent full autonomy and trusting it will follow instructions. The
  safest pattern is:

  Research Phase (restricted tools) →
  Human Approval →
  Implementation Phase (full tools)

  You want the AI doing work inside guardrails, not just reading about guardrails.

  ---
  Bottom Line

  CLAUDE.md can be ignored because it's just text in my context.

  Plan Mode cannot be ignored because it removes my ability to act.

  That's the difference between a rule and a constraint.

  For your future AI-assisted development projects, always ask:

  "Is this enforced by architecture, or just by trust?"

  If the answer is "just trust" — you're exposed.
